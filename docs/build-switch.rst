Step 4: Switch
==============
Materials:

* Switch

* Switch spacer

1. Use the flush cutters to cut open the two retention plastic tabs on the
   sides of the switch, as shown in the photo below.

2. Locate the switch leads (two black wires, about 55 cm length) leading from
   the battery assembly. Lay them along the dowel, running the wire through the
   rectangular cutout in the PDB. Solder the tinned end of one of the leads to
   the PDB  as shown in the photo below. Use the flush cutters to trim  the
   soldered wire. Make sure that there is enough wire length to insert a
   spacer between the battery and PDB.

3. Run the wires along the length of the dowel. Solder the opposite ends of
   the wires to the switch; as before, trim the soldered wires using flush cutters.
   Note: one of the wires must be soldered to the **middle** contact, and the other,
   to one of the other contacts (doesn't matter which one). It doesn't matter
   which of the two wires is soldered to the middle contact.

4. Use zipties  to fasten the LED strips and the wiring to the dowel.
   The zipties should fit in the spaces between LEDs. The head of the
   zipties should be in the middle of the empty side of the dowel (without LEDs
   or wiring) - not at the corner! Place zipties every 7-8 cm or so.
   Tighten them (but not too tight, to prevent them from breaking) and trim.
