Charging
===========
To charge the staff, turn it off by setting the switch in the OFF position.
Remove the endcap from the controller end (opposite to the switch).
Inside you will see a microcontroller with a micro-USB connector. Plug in a
USB charger; for best results, use a charger that can provide at least 1A
charging current.

You should see an orange LED indicating that the batteries are charging.
Full charge should take about 5 hrs.
