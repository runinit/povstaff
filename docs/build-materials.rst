Tools and materials
===================

You will need the following materials:

* `Kit of parts <https://www.tindie.com/products/irobotics/pov-shield/>`__ from
  my Tindie store. Make sure  to choose the option matching the order of signals
  on your LED strip (see details on product page in Tindie)

*  **APA102 (DotStar) LED strip, 144 LED/meter, black PCB**, from Adafruit or
   Aliexpress. You need 4 strips of 50cm (72 LEDs); you can also buy longer
   strips and cut them into 50cm pieces. The strips should not be waterproofed.
   Adafruit strips come with waterproof sheathing which you can just remove and
   discard.

*  Two **18650 Li-Ion batteries**. Look for high-capacity (at least 3000mAh),
   **protected** batteries from a reputable manufacturer such as Panasonic, Samsung,
   or Sanyo. Do not try to save money by buying no-name battery on eBay or Amazon;
   instead, use a specialized  store such as 18650batterystore.com

*  `Polycarbonate tube, 11F(55in/141cm) <https://flowtoys.com/long-tubes-5f-to-13f>`__,
   1 inch outer diameter, from flowtoys.com

*  1/2 inch (or 12 mm) square **wood dowel**, from HomeDepot or any other hardware
   store. You need two  pieces, each at least 52 cm (about 21")

*  Adafruit `ItsyBitsy M4<https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800>`__ or ItsyBitsy `nRF52840 <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4481>`__ microcontroller.
   The nRF52840 is slightly more expensive, but it comes with Bluetooth, which
   opens many additional possibilities. However, current version of my code
   doesn't use Bluetooth - this is planned for future upgrades. Do not use
   32u4 or M0 ItsyBitsy - they do not have enough RAM for our purposes.

Tools
-----
You will need the usual tools and supplies: wire strippers, flush cutters,
scissors, decent soldering iron,  electric tape, heat gun for
shrinking the shrink wrap, sharp model knife or utility knife. Needless to say,
you will also need a computer to program the microcontroller and a USB charger
(with microUSB cable) to charge the batteries.

In addition, you will need black spray paint for painting the wood dowels and
epoxy glue.
