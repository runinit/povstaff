Tools and materials
===================

You will need the following materials:

* `Kit of parts <https://www.tindie.com/products/irobotics/pov-staff-kit/>`__ from
  my Tindie store, version 4.

*  Two **18650 Li-Ion batteries**. Look for high-capacity (at least 3000mAh),
   **unprotected** batteries from a reputable manufacturer such as Panasonic, Samsung,
   or Sanyo. Do not try to save money by buying no-name battery on eBay or Amazon;
   instead, use a specialized  store such as `18650batterystore.com <http://18650batterystore.com>`__.
   Batteries must be **identical**, ideally from the same batch. Current rating
   (5A/10A/20A) doesn't matter much for this project. I used
   `these batteries <https://www.18650batterystore.com/products/sanyo-ncr18650ga>`__.

*  `Polycarbonate tube, 11F (55in/141cm) <https://flowtoys.com/long-tubes-5f-to-13f>`__,
   1 inch outer diameter, from flowtoys.com. Note: while the tube is listed as 55",
   the actual length is 54.5".

*  1/2 inch (or 12 mm) square **wood dowel**, from
   `HomeDepot <https://www.homedepot.com/p/Waddell-1-2-in-x-36-in-American-Basswood-Square-Dowel-8308U/100547367>`__
   or any other hardware store. You need two  pieces, each at least 52 cm (slightly over 20").

You will need the usual tools and supplies:

* wire strippers

* pliers

* flush cutters

* scissors

* decent soldering iron, solder, and flux

* heat gun

* hack saw

* electric tape, black, 3/4"

You will also need a computer with WiFi  to upload the images  and a charger
