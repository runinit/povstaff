Step 1: Battery assembly
==========================
**Warning**: In this step, you will be soldering leads to Li-Ion batteries.
This could be dangerous if not done right! Please read all instructions
carefully and wear eye protection. You are working at your own risk!

Materials and tools used:

* Two 18650 Li-Ion batteries

* Two battery  wire harnesses

* Two Power Distribution Boards (PDB)

* Spacers

* Shrink wrap (from kit of parts)

* Soldering Iron, solder, flux

1. Find the first battery wire harness (28cm, 4 wire). Put one piece of the
   8mm diameter shrink wrap on one end of the harness (note: **do not** shrink
   it). Now, insert the 4 tinned ends of the wire harness into the holes of the
   PDB as shown  below. You must be inserting from the side with label **PDB-A**
   (or **PDB-B**). The wire with white stripe should go into the hole under the  +
   sign as shown in the photo below.

2.  Solder the wires from the opposite side. Use flush cutters to trim
    protruding wires, **leaving about 2mm**.

3. Repeat steps 1, 2 with the opposite end of the wire harness and the second PDB.



4. Solder the two wire leads from the  wire harness to negative (-)
   terminal of each battery. Follow instructions on `this page <https://oscarliang.com/solder-li-ion-battery-18650/>`__
   for soldering. Tip: an easy way to keep the battery vertical while soldering
   is by using the clamp as shown in the photo below.

5. Find the second battery wire harness with switch leads (it uses red wire).
   Insert it through both pieces of shrink wrap.

6. Turn the batteries over, with the positive terminal up. Use voltmeter to
   check the voltage difference between the positive terminals of the two batteries.
   If it is more than 0.1V, find a low ommage resistor (1 Ohm or about);  press and hold
   it against the two positive terminals, to equalize the voltage.

7. Solder the two red leads
   to positive terminals of the batteries. Make sure the direction they are
   pointing is same as the direction of the black leads on the negative terminal.

8. Arrange the two batteries in line, placing the spacer between them. (Use the
   spacer with partly covered top and bottom).
   Carefully straighten the wires  along the surface of the batteries,
   making sure they do not cross. Slide the shrink wrap as far out as possible.
   Use electric tape to temporarily attach the wires to the batteries.
   Make sure that the distance between each PDB and the
   battery allows you to insert the remaining spacers.

9. Take the piece of the large diameter shrink wrap and put it over the middle
   section of battery assembly. Push the batteries and spacer tightly together,
   being careful not to pinch any wires. If necessary, pull out  the smaller
   shrink wrap (it must cover the wires where they rest against the end of the battery).
   Use the heat gun at low temperature setting  to shrink the large shrink
   wrap; do not shrink the smaller ones.

10. This completes the battery assembly. The side with long 2-wire leads is
    the **switch** side; the opposite side (with the bullet connector) is the
    **controller** side.
