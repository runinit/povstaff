1. Custom-made POV controller  for ItsyBitsy, containing Inertial Motion Unit, battery
   charge circuit, and more.

2. Two Power Distribution Boards (PDB). Note: the PDB exists in two variants,
   PDB-A and PDB-B. Choose the variant that matches the order of signals on your
   LED strip (see below)

Power Distribution Board variants
----------------------------------
As mentioned above, there are two variants of the kit which contain different
Power Distribution Boards: PDB-A and PDB-B. The correct option for you depends on
the order of signals on your LED strips; unfortunately, there is no standard order.

Place the strip horizontally so that the signal travels from left to right.

* If the top signal is Ground (usually labeled G) and bottom signal is 5V, then
  you need **variant A**.

* If the top signal is 5V and bottom signal is Ground, you need **variant B**.
