Power Distribution Board variants
----------------------------------
As mentioned above, there are two variants of the kit which contain different
Power Distribution Boards: PDB-A and PDB-B. The correct option for you depends on
the order of signals on your LED strips; unfortunately, there is no standard order.

Place the strip horizontally so that the signal travels from left to right.

* If the top signal is Ground (usually labeled G) and bottom signal is 5V, then
  you need **variant A**.

* If the top signal is 5V and bottom signal is Ground, you need **variant B**.
