Step 8: Testing
===============================
Before continuing, remove the USB cable from the controller. Make sure the
switch is in middle ("off") position.

1. Plug the 5-pin JST connector into the POV controller as shown below.

2. By now, all electric connections are complete. Before inserting the assembled
   pieces into the tube, you need to  test it. Turn the switch on (it is a 3-position
   switch; you will need to find out which of the 3 positions is "on".
   The middle position is always "off" ). The staff must come to life, lighting
   up some LEDs to indicate the battery charge - the more LEDs, the higher the
   charge. If no LEDs come light up, either something is wrong with the wiring,
   or the batteries are completely discharged. In the latter case, you will need
   to charge the batteries as described in the user guide.


3. If everything worked OK so far, try twisting the controller between your
   fingers back and forth. You should see green and red lights travelling the
   length of the staff --  the faster you move the controller, the quicker the
   lights should move.  If this works, your staff is working as intended and
   you can move to the final assembly.
