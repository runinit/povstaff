# POV Staff Software

This folder contains software for POV Staff project.  It should be uploaded
to the ItsyBitsy (M4 or nRF52840 only) using one of the methods below:

* You can use a pre-compiled binary (in `binaries` folder). This is described in
  detail in the user guide: http://povstaff.readthedocs.io

* Alternatively, you can compile the code yourself, using Arduino IDE version
  1.8 or later.   You will need to install POV library from  
  https://github.com/shurik179/pov-library (you can install it using Arduino
  Library manager).

  Copy `povstaff` folder into your Arduino sketch directory and open in Arduino IDE.
  Remember to select `TinyUSB` in `Tools->USB stack` menu of Arduino IDE.
